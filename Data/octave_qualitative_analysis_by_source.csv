He does not tune each note in turn up or down the scale, and he does not specifically tune together the same notes on different panpipes, or check octaves or fifths. The only method seems to be to play the actual music that belongs to it, on a set that is to be tuned, and see if it fits with what is expected. Then two different panpipes of a similar pitch range are tested together, and so on through the set. For testing any particular panpipe, the one most often chosen to play against it is the one that stands next to it during the dance.'"

'Kufuna has never shown any sign that he conceived of more than precisely one tuning pattern for his likembe. He always tuned his instrument to the same hexa- tonic scale, though with certain objectively measurable fluctuations in the intervals. These fluctuations, however, occurred within a clearly delimited margin of tolerance that was intra-culturally acceptable to him.' It's also curious to hear that the author does not seem to mind the differences in tuning, despite being able to perceive them."

18,Aning,1982,Tuning the kora: A case study of the norms of a Gambian musician,No,"The author writes about octaves in the tuning of the kora, and notes that many strings are an octave apart. However, deviations from the octave leave the author unsure about whether there is a systematically regular tuning pattern for the kora. However there are a remarkable number of strings tuned to within 20 cents of an octave. The author repeatedly neglects to take into account imprecision in both tuning fork measurements, and the human ear, as acceptable reasons for deviations from theoretical ideals. Incidentally, it is noted that the tuner pays particular attention to the intonation of two sets of strings, each a fifth apart.",No,,,,2,0,2,1,0,
19,"Ho, Han",1982,On Chinese scales and national modes,No,"The author remarks little on the use of the octave, and seems to have a similar understanding to that of Western music theory.
